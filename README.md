## What is this Firmware?

On Tenstorrent devices we have a system management processor.
This processor is responsible for
    - Turning the hardware on
    - Making sure that external i/o (pcie, eth, dram, etc.) can connect and remain connected while the board is recieving power
    - Ensuring that we never exceed the power or temperature envolope that the card and chip were designed to operate in
And the firmware code encapsulates this functionality

## Why is this a binary release

Tenstorrent products contain IP from third parties, we have agreements with these third parties which keeps us from distributing source code related to their property.
Therefore releasing the fw source code, in its current form, would require disentangling what we have ownership of vs. what is shared. Effectively requiring us to rewrite it to isolate anything proprietary, so we made the decision to spend the resources to
guarantee to make what we can of future fw open-source rather than going back to rewrite what we already have.

If you are interested in the extent that applications interact with this firmware, see [UMD](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-umd).

## Available Firmware

| Firmware | Description |

| [`fw_pack-19.5.0.fwbundle`](fw_pack-19.5.0.fwbundle) | is a package containing the  combined firmware image to flash Grayskull(gs),  Wormhole(wh) and  Blackhole(bh) boards.|

## Release Notes

# v19.5.0

We are pleased to announce the release of TT Zephyr Platforms firmware version 19.5.0 🥳🎉.

Major enhancements with this release include:

## Wormhole Changes

### Stability Improvements

- Update Wormhole ERISC FW to 7.5.0, change list from 7.2.0:
  - 7.5.0
    - Adjust the resend chip info packet time to resolve the link training failures with ANLT ports
    - Minimize static training retries to compensate for longer delays in the training sequence
    - Adjust DFE settings for weak lanes only to improve the link stability
  - 7.4.0
    - Code clean-up and documentation
    - Use register defines and convert arrays into data structures
  - 7.3.0
    - Fix retrain hangs with Active Cables
    - Adjust DFE value to improve BER on WH UBB QSFP ports
    - Link quality improvements to non-retimer long trace on WH UBB
    - Updated retraining logic to set train_status to LINK_TRAIN_TRAINING when entering into retraining
    - Remove link_training_fw_phony debug feature from eth_init to free up more space

## Blackhole Changes

### p150 Tensix Core Count

Beginning January 2026, all Blackhole p150 accelerator cards (p150a, p150b) will ship with **120 Tensix cores** instead of 140. To present a unified interface to metal and other system software, firmware v19.5.0 and later will change the core count on all existing cards to 120.  Typical workloads show a non-material (~1–2%) performance difference.
You may observe a change in grid size in metal, which may require updates to applications that depend on grid layout.

### Stability Improvements

- Fixed boardcfg loading error handling in recovery image
- Updated Blackhole ERISC FW to v1.8.1, change list from v1.7.1:
  - v1.8.1 (2025-01-23)
    - Change P150 products to use Manual EQ training mode
    - Updated MACPCS init sequence to wait longer before SerDes reinit
    - Added wait for LCPLL lock check in SerDes init before training start
    - Fixed bug where calling eth_mac_pcs_reinit with option = 1 would immediately return without running the function
    - Increased AN timeout and disabled SerDes lt_timeout_enable to allow for better control of the ANLT sequence via FW
  - v1.8.0 (2026-01-20)
    - Updated TX/RX remapping for P300 and P150
    - Updated settings to improve PRBS test mode
      - Keep TX BIST enabled even on Serdes training fail
      - Disable FW features at beginning of initialization for PRBS tests
    - Restore some of the timeout changes to pre v1.7.1 settings as new timeouts proved to be problematic on galaxy systems
    - Cleaned up RX retraining sequence for Manual EQ
    - Added tx_barrier to sync TX/RX across multiple eth controllers on init
    - Added eth_link_recovery to eth_api_table to allow access to runtime FW
    - Added disable_l1_cache function to disable data cache completely, function called in main() of base FW and all test FWs
    - Ensure eth_api_table is not wiped between inits
    - Changed some ETH messages:
      - ETH msg PORT_REINIT -> PORT_REINIT_MACPCS: Initiates fill initialization sequence based on selected option
      - ETH msg PORT_RETRAIN -> PORT_REINIT_SERDES: Only initiates serdes initalization sequence based on selected option

### Power Management

- Galaxy TDP limit reduced from 170 W to 130 W to stay within system power limits
- Disabled PHY powerdown for MRISC on Galaxy systems to address DRAM funtest regression

### Telemetry & Monitoring

- Added telemetry entries for enabled AICLK min/max arbiters (`TAG_ENABLED_MIN_ARB` and `TAG_ENABLED_MAX_ARB`)
- Added telemetry for effective AICLK min/max arbiter values (`TAG_AICLK_ARB_MIN` and `TAG_AICLK_ARB_MAX`)
- Added Doxygen documentation for `aiclk_arb_max` and `aiclk_arb_min` enumerations
- PVT sensor message fixes
  - Revert backward-incompatible message interface changes to `READ_{TS,PD,VM}` introduced in v19.1.0
  - Fixed conversion truncation issue in voltage monitoring messages
  - Improved error checking in PVT functions
- Added tracing for AICLK updates (disabled by default)

### Drivers

- Added interrupt support to ARC DMA driver and enabled it by default
- Added "is alive" check to PVT sensor drivers

### Tooling

- Add support for newer P300 boards to blackhole recovery script
- Properly support flash read across multiple blocks with pyocd
- tt-tracing improvements
  - Added `-b` command-line argument to select BAR (bar0 or bar4)
  - Improved tracing performance when running in parallel with `tt-burnin`
  - Fixed to send enable tracing command only once (not on every loop iteration)
  - Updated documentation with coding examples for custom tracing events
  - Fixed babeltrace2 version to 2.0.4 for compatibility

### Build System & Dependencies

- Migrated from patch-based workflow to Zephyr fork
- Removed all usages of `west patch` treewide
- Fixed git describe to use correct module directory (enables correct version tags for applications built in different repositories)

## Grendel Changes

- Initial support added for the Grendel SMC platform
  - 4-core Berkeley Rocketcore with peripheral complement for external device interfacing
- Initial devicetree definition
- Virtual console driver for simulation debugging via printf
- Basic build workflow for CI validation
